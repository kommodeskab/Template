class BaseMetric:
    """
    This is a base class for metrics.
    Each metric should implement the following methods:
        - `add()`: called for each batch during validation. Should update the metric's internal state based on the model's outputs and the ground truth.
        - `compute()`: called at the end of each validation epoch. Should compute and return the final metric value based on the accumulated state from `add()`.
        - `reset()`: called at the end of each validation epoch after `compute()`. Should reset the metric's internal state for the next epoch.
        - `to()`: called at the start of training. Should move any internal tensors to the specified device.
        - `name()`: should return a string name for the metric, which will be used for logging.
